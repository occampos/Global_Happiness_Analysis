# Patterns in Global Happiness

The World Happiness Report, a publication by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, draws its insights from Gallup World Poll data. This report mirrors the global plea for greater emphasis on the global call for prioritizing happiness and well-being in governmental policy considerations. It assesses the current global happiness levels and delves into how the study of happiness clarifies the differences in happiness among individuals and nations, emphasizing its significance in policymaking.

The annual happiness rankings are rooted in life evaluations conducted through the Gallup World Poll. These rankings stem from responses to the principal life evaluation question, utilizing the Cantril ladder. This approach prompts individuals to visualize a scale where 10 signifies the highest possible life satisfaction and 0 signifies the lowest. Respondents are then prompted to assess their own current lives on this scale.

This analysis is segmented into two parts: one focusing on the ongoing year of 2023 and another that delves into a comprehensive review spanning all documented years.

*Relveant questuons include:*
+ What country-specific features are most commonly associated with higher levels of happiness?
+ Does a general upward trend in happiness exist? Is happiness globally correlated, or does it predominantly manifest at an individual country level?
+ Can a nation experiencing unhappiness anticipate a progression towards greater happiness over time?
